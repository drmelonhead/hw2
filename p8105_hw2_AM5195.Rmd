# Problem 1
The first part of this problem is to import and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel data.
```{r}
trash_df = 
  readxl::read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                     sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel", 
    range ="A2:N406") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster))

```


Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
